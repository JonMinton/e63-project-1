# Simplified Approach

## Introduction

Current plan is to develop a simplified full stack version of the app which uses the following classes:

- Customer
- Merchant
- Account
- Transaction

For the first verison the following classes will ••not•• be used:

- Tag
- Bank


## Approach 

- Start with simplest/least dependant class
    - build page
    - build controller
    - build class 
    - build repository
    - build sql structure
- Then repeat with all others

- Merchant
    - [ ] page
    - [ ] controller
    - [ ] class
    - [ ] repository
    - [ ] sql table
